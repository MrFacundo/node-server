# node-server exercise

Create a node webserver

  it should serve port 5000
  it should include a simple html page, showing some text and a picture
  it should answer requests containing at least two different keywords with two distinct json objects

Create a separate html page that connects to the server

  it should make a request usind one of the two keywords [X]
  it should receive the response and if the response is a json object, analyse and display it [X]

Bonus (if you already worked with Electron): Create an Electron App

  it should make a request usind one of the two keywords
  it should receive the response and if the response is a json object, analyse and display it
  
How would this be extended for a simple account management (login service), so the json response depends on the user making the request? [X]
